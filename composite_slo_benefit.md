# **Proposal: Moving to a Composite SLO Model for Multi-Cluster Kubernetes**

## **1. Executive Summary**
### **Current Problem:**
- Traditional SLO models track each Kubernetes cluster independently.
- No unified view of overall platform reliability.
- Cluster failures trigger isolated SLO breaches, even if workloads are resilient.
- Difficult to align multiple cluster SLOs with business SLAs.

### **Proposed Solution: Composite SLO Model**
- Aggregate **SLOs from all clusters** into a **single reliability metric**.
- Weighted SLO calculation ensures **balanced performance evaluation**.
- Enables **cross-cluster failover** without immediate SLO breaches.
- Simplifies **monitoring, reporting, and incident response**.

## **2. Limitations of the Traditional SLO Model**
| **Issue** | **Impact** |
|------------------|------------|
| **No Unified Reliability Metric** | Fragmented tracking of availability across multiple clusters. |
| **Operational Overhead** | Managing separate SLOs for each cluster is complex. |
| **SLO Breaches from Local Failures** | Single cluster failures trigger breaches even when service remains operational. |
| **Difficult SLA Alignment** | Customers expect service-level availability, not per-cluster uptime. |

## **3. Benefits of the Composite SLO Model**
| **Advantage** | **Business Impact** |
|------------------|----------------------|
| ‚úÖ **Single Unified SLO** | A single metric for reliability across clusters. |
| ‚úÖ **Better SLA Alignment** | Matches customer expectations for service-wide availability. |
| ‚úÖ **Cross-Cluster Failover Resilience** | Shifts workloads between clusters to prevent SLO breaches. |
| ‚úÖ **Operational Efficiency** | Reduces monitoring complexity and improves incident response. |
| ‚úÖ **Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Kubernetes Ready** | Works across AWS, Azure, GCP, and On-Prem clusters. |

## **4. How the Composite SLO Model Works**
- **Weighting Criteria:** Each cluster contributes to the overall SLO based on:
  - **Workload Share** (Traffic handled by each cluster).
  - **Cluster Criticality** (Production vs. failover clusters).
  - **Historical Reliability** (Past incidents and error budget consumption).

### **Formula for Composite SLO:**
\[
\text{Composite SLO} = \sum (\text{Cluster SLO} \times \text{Weight})
\]

#### **Example Weighting for Three Clusters:**
| **Cluster** | **SLO (%)** | **Weight (%)** | **Weighted SLO Contribution** |
|------------|------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Cluster A** (Primary) | 99.95 | 50% | 49.98 |
| **Cluster B** (Regional) | 99.90 | 30% | 29.97 |
| **Cluster C** (Failover) | 99.85 | 20% | 19.97 |
| **Total Composite SLO** | N/A | 100% | **99.92%** |

üìå **Key Takeaway**: Even if Cluster C experiences downtime, the overall Composite SLO remains **above 99.9%**, preventing unnecessary incident escalations.

## **5. Incident Management & Burn Rate Monitoring**
- Composite SLO enables **multi-cluster burn rate tracking**.
- **Incident Thresholds:**
  - **Burn Rate ‚â• 5 (1 hour window):** Critical incident üö®
  - **Burn Rate ‚â• 2 (6 hour window):** Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - **Burn Rate ‚â• 1 (24 hour window):** Monitor trends üìä
- **Proactive Failover:** If one cluster's burn rate spikes, shift traffic to healthier clusters.

## **6. Implementation Plan**
### **Phase 1: Proof of Concept (3 Months)**
- Define **initial composite SLO formula**.
- Implement **Prometheus/Grafana dashboard** for monitoring.
- Compare **existing vs. composite SLO model**.

### **Phase 2: Production Rollout (6 Months)**
- Adjust **weighting dynamically** based on real-time workloads.
- Implement **alerting system for burn rate monitoring**.
- Train **SRE teams on new incident response process**.

### **Phase 3: SLA Alignment (Ongoing)**
- Validate **historical compliance against business SLAs**.
- Use composite SLOs for **executive-level reporting**.

## **7. Key Takeaways & Call to Action**
- **Traditional SLOs are not scalable for multi-cluster Kubernetes.**
- **Composite SLOs offer a single, business-aligned reliability metric.**
- **Improves incident response and SLA adherence.**
- **Next Step:** Proceed with Phase 1 implementation.

üì¢ **Recommendation:** Approve adoption of **Composite SLO Model** for a **trial phase** in multi-cluster Kubernetes environments.
