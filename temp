Background

The OpenShift Container Platform has become the backbone of modern enterprise application deployment due to its scalability, resiliency, and native support for cloud-native workloads. In large-scale environments, organizations often operate multiple OpenShift clusters across regions or zones to ensure high availability, performance isolation, disaster recovery, and compliance.

Managing a multi-cluster OpenShift environment is inherently complex. It involves not only orchestrating application workloads but also ensuring the consistent availability and performance of both internal platform components and external supporting systems that together uphold the service reliability of the platform.

Internal Dependencies

At the core of each OpenShift cluster lie critical components that must be continuously healthy and performant to ensure platform stability. These include:
	•	Kubernetes Control Plane (kube-apiserver, controller-manager, scheduler)
	•	OpenShift-Specific Controllers and Operators
	•	Worker and Infra Nodes (underlying compute and networking resources)
	•	Etcd Cluster (distributed key-value store for cluster state)
	•	Storage Services such as Ceph or other persistent volume backends
	•	Cluster Networking Components including ingress controllers, DNS, and service meshes

A failure or degradation in any of these components can have a direct impact on application availability or developer productivity.

External Dependencies

Beyond the core cluster, the platform relies on a rich ecosystem of external services for CI/CD, security, identity, and configuration management. These are not part of the OpenShift platform itself but are critical to its operations:
	•	Vault – for secrets management and dynamic credential provisioning
	•	Artifactory or Internal Registry – for container image distribution and validation
	•	Single Sign-On (SSO) – for user authentication and access federation
	•	Jenkins/GitLab CI – for continuous integration pipelines
	•	Ansible Tower (AAPS) – for day-2 operations, automation workflows, and patching
	•	Monitoring and Logging Tools (e.g., Prometheus, Splunk, EFK/ELK stack) – for observability

These external dependencies are often shared services, making their availability and performance equally critical to overall platform service objectives.
