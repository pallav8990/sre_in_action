To convince someone who prefers running scripts directly on a server over using SREHubApp, you need to focus on long-term maintainability, scalability, visibility, and security — all things platform folks value.

Here’s how you can pitch it, point-by-point:

⸻

1. Centralized Control & Visibility

Script on server:
	•	Hidden away — no visibility unless you SSH in
	•	No logs/history unless explicitly configured

SREHubApp:
	•	Central place to view, trigger, monitor, and audit all actions
	•	Anyone with access can see the results without needing shell access
	•	Promotes team transparency and self-service

⸻

2. Reusability Across Teams

Script on server:
	•	Usually written for a specific use case
	•	Hard to scale or generalize

SREHubApp:
	•	Uses module bricks that are reusable across use cases
	•	A single AquaScan brick can be reused for CI/CD, daily scans, and custom reports

⸻

3. Security & Access Control

Script on server:
	•	Secrets often sit in env vars or files
	•	Server credentials can be misused

SREHubApp:
	•	Secure secrets management (e.g., Vault integration)
	•	Uses tokenized access, RBAC, and API auditing
	•	Minimizes “server hopping” and human error

⸻

4. Auditability & Compliance

Script on server:
	•	No built-in audit trail or centralized logging
	•	Not easy to prove who did what and when

SREHubApp:
	•	API logs, user-triggered actions, and correlation history are all auditable
	•	Supports compliance and audit readiness

⸻

5. Scalability

Script on server:
	•	Doesn’t scale well — especially across clusters, environments, or tools
	•	Tightly coupled to one host/setup

SREHubApp:
	•	Designed to scale across multiple clouds, clusters, and services
	•	You can connect to 10 clusters and JFrog instances from the same app

⸻

6. Modern SRE Culture

You’re building a platform, not just automating a script.
SREHubApp aligns with:
	•	Self-service DevOps
	•	API-first culture
	•	Platform engineering best practices

⸻

One-Liner Summary (for a senior):

“Running the script on a server solves today’s need. Using SREHubApp turns that solution into a product — reusable, auditable, secure, and scalable for the entire org.”
