SREHubApp: The Correlation Engine Powering SRE 2.0




SREHubApp is a next-generation SRE 2.0 platform built to unify reliability, automation, and intelligent decision-making.

Designed as a powerful correlation engine, it transforms scattered signals into meaningful insights — enabling faster root cause identification, proactive responses, and system-wide understanding.

As a centralized API hub, SREHubApp streamlines access to platform services, eliminates operational silos, and empowers teams with self-service capabilities.

With modular architecture, asynchronous intelligence, and real-time data fusion, SREHubApp redefines how reliability is engineered, scaled, and delivered.

This is not just a system of record — it’s a system of action, built for the future of site reliability.
