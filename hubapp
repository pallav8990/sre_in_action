#objective

The Self-Service API Gateway is a stateless, centralized integration platform designed to streamline SRE operations by aggregating data, correlating insights, automating responses, and enabling self-service interactions. The core objectives of this project are:

1. Establish a Centralized API for All Underlying Systems
	•	Develop a unified API gateway that consolidates access to Kubernetes, JFrog, ATAAS, Splunk, and other observability/automation platforms.
	•	Standardize data retrieval and interactions across multiple systems to improve accessibility and integration efficiency.
	•	Eliminate the need for direct tool logins, enabling seamless cross-platform data consumption.

2. Build a Correlation-Driven Platform as the Foundation of SRE Practices
	•	Implement multi-source data correlation to provide a holistic view of system health, failures, and performance trends.
	•	Develop an intelligent event-processing mechanism that links metrics, logs, and alerts to accelerate root cause analysis (RCA).
	•	Enable proactive issue detection by identifying patterns across infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and observability tools.

3. Develop an Advanced Automation Framework for Event Triggers, Chained Workflows & Self-Healing
	•	Design an event-driven automation engine that responds dynamically to correlated system insights.
	•	Enable chained automation sequences, allowing multiple interdependent remediation steps to be triggered programmatically.
	•	Implement self-healing capabilities, where failures are detected and automatically mitigated through predefined actions.

4. Provide a Centralized Reporting and Data Aggregation Solution
	•	Create a reporting API that aggregates and structures data from multiple sources for performance tracking, SLO compliance, and incident analysis.
	•	Support on-demand and scheduled report generation, reducing the manual effort required for data consolidation.
	•	Facilitate historical trend analysis to optimize system reliability and capacity planning.

5. Establish an Integration Gateway for Cross-Platform Interoperability
	•	Act as a bridge between multiple observability, monitoring, CI/CD, and automation tools, ensuring seamless interoperability.
	•	Provide a standardized API contract that simplifies multi-tool integration and unifies data formats.
	•	Ensure scalability and extensibility, allowing easy onboarding of additional third-party systems.

6. Enable Conversational Self-Service Capabilities
	•	Extend API functionalities to a virtual assistant, allowing users to retrieve data and execute actions via conversational interfaces.
	•	Support self-service troubleshooting and automation execution, enabling users to query system health, trigger workflows, and generate reports without manual intervention.
	•	Enhance user experience by providing natural language-driven interactions, making complex SRE tasks accessible to a wider audience.

Conclusion

This project aims to redefine SRE operations by creating a stateless, API-first solution that integrates multiple observability and automation tools under a single access layer. With correlation at its core, it will drive proactive monitoring, automated remediation, and self-service capabilities, leading to enhanced reliability, efficiency, and operational excellence.
